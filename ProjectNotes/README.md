# Changes for Order System in relation to adding archive

## Database related
- SQL queries for order
```
Old show order sql query:
"SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY orderDate DESC LIMIT $start_index, $results_per_page";
```
```
New query for show orders:
"SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orderStatus != 'cancelled' ORDER BY orderDate DESC LIMIT $start_index, $results_per_page";
```
```
Query for show orders in archives:
â€œSELECT * FROM orders WHERE orderStatus = 'cancelled' ORDER BY orderDate DESC LIMIT $start_index, $results_per_page"
```
